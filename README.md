# Tyk Schemas

Repository for all schemas compatible with Tyk objects and files.

**This project is an MVP and still WIP**

## Purpose
JSON, YAML and maybe more schemas for various file types and objects used by Tyk products. 
You can use these schemas in your IDE or favourite editor to get autocompletion or code validation of all your Tyk related work.



## JSON schemas
Check [JSON schemas README](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-schemas/blob/main/JSON/README.md) for details on Tyk JSON schemas.
